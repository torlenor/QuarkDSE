Implementation of dressing function calculation for a quark propagator DSE. 
The implementation is once done for CPU and also for GPU using OpenCL. This 
project was part of a lecture about numerical methods in particle physics. 

What the code does is, it solves a system of coupled integral equations using 
Gauss-Legendre and Gauss-Tschebyshev integration.
